Learning_1D file contains the python files for modeling with white noise evoked 
activity as input and modeling with Hebbian learning.

1. BlackBox.py

Contains functions for iterative applying the prior responses as inputs. 
Generate the Figure 3.19 in the thesis.

2. HebbianOjyRule.py

Contains modeling with Hebbian learning in simplified one input feedforward 
recurrent network. 
Including the time development of projection ratio (Figure 3.20) and the 
time development of feedforward recurrent alignment (Figure 3.21).
